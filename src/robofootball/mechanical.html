                        The mechanical engineering majors on the team were tasked with designing and building all eleven of the robots on the team. They have improved on designs of old and engineered entirely new robots to play for the team this year.

                    <h2><br>Design Details</h2>
                        <p>
                            The mechanical engineers on this team were required to design 6 new robots from
                            the ground up, as well as make improvements to the 5 that were kept from last year.
                            This was completed through a systematic process of concept design, manufacturing,
                            testing, and redesign.

                                <img src="img/rb.jpg" alt="Center" />
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-1-special">
                                <img src="img/center.jpg" alt="Running Back" />

                        <p>
                        These team members began the process by using SolidWorks to draw up concepts
                        of the robots. The models could be manipulated and tested to find any errors or
                        weak points. For a competitive team, individual robots had to be designed to exceed
                        at their specific function. The 6 new robots were the quarterback, center, kicker,
                        running back, and 2 wide receivers. This called for a lot of brainstorming and
                        idea-generation. Certain functions were replicated from the designs of previous
                        years, and others were entirely new. Servos and electric motors were employed to
                        complete all required functions; including swinging arms, sliding pins, opening and
                        closing a gripper, and rotating launch wheels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        When the models were satisfactory, each part was generated into a 2-dimensional
                        contour code that was used in the machine shop. This code allowed for precision
                        cuts on a CNC table, and created exact parts again and again out of high density
                        plastic. When all parts were cut for a specific robot, assembly began. The engineers
                        ensured that all parts fit together exactly, so that the robots would run just as well
                        as they were designed. Countless hours were spent sanding edges and measuring
                        to guarantee perfect operation. Once a robot was completely assembled, it was
                        handed off to the electrical engineers for wiring.
